# WeatherApp1_Android
This is the repository for TAMK's Mobile App Development 1 final project (Android part)

## Important
1. This is my first project working with native android java, so there are still flaws that should be changed
2. I have removed the API key used in this app, so you need to add your own API key
3. The source code is open, but there is absolutely NO guarantee that:
1. The app will work with your device 
2. The api key provided is usable (my weather api key is from: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#current)
4. Use the source code at your own risk

The weather icons used in this project is from https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/weather-color-2
