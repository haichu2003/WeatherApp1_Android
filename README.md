# WeatherApp1_Android
This is the repository for TAMK's Mobile App Development 1 final project (Android part)

## Important
* This is my first project working with native android java, so there are still flaws that should be changed
* I have removed the API key used in this app, so you need to add your own API key
* The source code is open, but there is absolutely NO guarantee that:
  * The app will work with your device 
  * The api key provided is usable (my weather api key is from: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#current)
* Use the source code at your own risk

The weather icons used in this project is from https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/weather-color-2
